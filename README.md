# bookstoreapp

This project has several requirements like:
Create a search form with an input field where the user can enter a book title or author name.


Retrieve the book data for the search query entered by the user from a book API. Use the Google Books API (example link: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=percy+jackson) to fetch data for the books.


Display the book data on the page, including the book title, author name, cover image, and other relevant information.


Store the user's search query in localStorage so that their search history is displayed the next time they visit the page. Show their search history in another page as shown in the figma.


Allow the user to view their search history and click on previous search queries to view the book data again.


Allow the user to clear their search history.


Deploy the project.
